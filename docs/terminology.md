# Etymology

The names Pcodec and Pco were chosen for these reasons:
* "Pico" suggests that it makes very small things.
* Pco is reminiscent of qco, its predecessor.
* Pco is reminiscent of PancakeDB (Pancake COmpressed). Though PancakeDB is now
  history, it had a good name.
* Pcodec is short, provides some semantic meaning, and should be easy to
  search for.

The names are used for these purposes:
* pco => the data format, nickname for the compression algorithm (also: Rust library)
* pco\_cli => the binary crate name
* pcodec => the repo, the compression algorithm (also: CLI, Python library)
