// Internally, here's how we should model each mode:
//
// Classic: The data is drawn from a smooth distribution.
//   Most natural data is like this.
//
// IntMult: The data is generated by 2 smooth distributions:
//   one whose outputs are multiplied by the base, and another whose outputs
//   are in the range [0, base). The 2nd process is often but not always
//   trivial.
//
// FloatMult: The data is generated by a smooth distribution
//   whose outputs get multiplied by the base and perturbed by floating point
//   errors.
//
// FloatQuant: The data is generated by first drawing from a smooth distribution
//   on low-precision floats, then widening the result by adding
//   less-significant bits drawn from a second, very low-entropy distribution
//   (e.g. in the common case, one that always produces zeros).
//
// Note the differences between int mult and float mult,
// which have equivalent formulas.

/// A variation of how pco serializes and deserializes numbers.
///
/// Each mode splits the vector of numbers into one or two vectors of latents,
/// with a different formula for how the split and join is done.
/// We have delibrately written the formulas below in a slightly wrong way to
/// convey the correct intuition without dealing with implementation
/// complexities.
/// Slightly more rigorous formulas are in format.md.
